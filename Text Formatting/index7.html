      I update my GitHub with weekly HTML practice challenges to build
      foundational skills.<br />
      <br />I attend four gym workouts every week along with Saturday soccer
      matches that leave me drenched.<br /><br />I dedicate morning sessions to
      learning front-end certifications on IBM, Microsoft, and Meta tracks.

      Soon I'll design a final portfolio HTML-only website showcasing every HTML
      concept I've mastered with confidence always.
    </p>

    <p>
      I carefully structure each HTML-only project with semantic tags to cover
      tables, forms, and accessibility best practices.<br />I customize image
      galleries on unsplash.com to enhance visual appeal inspired by my interior
      design interests.<br /><br />I track daily progress on my
      biblestudyinjesuschrist Instagram page and integrate prayers into captions
      for personal growth.

      Next milestone: launch a responsive resume page that subtly weaves
      architecture and CAD technician experience into a polished front-end
      design. I'll also tweet project updates and include README documentation
      soon.
