      <h1>Experiencing Toronto</h1>
      <p>
        Visiting Toronto is like walking into a giant mosaic. Every piece—every
        neighborhood, every language, every face—tells part of a bigger story.
        This isn’t just a city you pass through. It’s one you feel.
      </p>
      <p>
        My first few days in Toronto were filled with little surprises—smiling
        strangers on the subway, the buzz of different languages in a single
        cafe, and the blend of modern towers standing next to historic
        buildings. Whether you’re sipping coffee in Kensington Market or
        standing at the base of the CN Tower, there’s this quiet realization:
        Toronto is alive, and somehow, you become part of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This blog isn’t just a guide—it’s a journey. If you’re thinking about
        visiting or just want to feel closer to this incredible city, keep
        reading.

        <p>
          Toronto isn’t just a place on a map—it’s a feeling. It’s where dreams
          take the subway, and every street has something to say. From the old
          brick buildings of the Distillery District to the bright energy of
          Yonge-Dundas Square, there’s always something happening.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can walk beside a Nigerian grandma buying plantains, a Korean
          artist sketching street life, and a Brazilian musician playing guitar
          at the park—all in one afternoon. That’s the magic of Toronto. You
          don’t just visit—you blend in, you belong.

          Toronto is packed with unforgettable sights and photo-worthy stops.
          Here are some must-sees:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>CN Tower:</strong> Get a sky-high view of the city from 553
            meters above. The glass floor is scary but worth it!
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Toronto Islands:</strong> Hop on a ferry and enjoy peaceful
            beaches, bike rides, and a killer skyline view.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Graffiti Alley:</strong> A bold, colorful street full of
            street art and attitude. Don’t forget your camera.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>High Park:</strong> Perfect for a nature break—cherry
            blossoms in spring, maple leaves in fall.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Kensington Market:</strong> A funky neighborhood full of
            vintage shops, world food, and street performers.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Whether you explore by foot, bike, or streetcar, the city keeps
          surprising you.

        <p>
          Toronto isn’t just multicultural—it’s built on culture. You don’t have
          to visit museums to feel it. It’s in the music, the food, the street
          signs, and even the slang.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Food:</strong> One day you’re eating Jamaican patties, the
            next it’s Korean BBQ or Ethiopian injera. It’s a foodie's dream.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Festivals:</strong> Caribana, Nuit Blanche, and the Toronto
            International Film Festival (TIFF) bring the city to life
            year-round.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Languages:</strong> Over 200 languages spoken. You might
            hear Somali, Tagalog, or Portuguese on your way to the mall.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Style:</strong> From streetwear to vintage, every part of
            town has its own vibe and fashion flavor.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In Toronto, culture isn’t just something you see—it’s something you
          live.
